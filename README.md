## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Fetch Metadata**: Gets track info from Spotify API
2. **Multi-Source Search**: Searches across multiple free sources in priority order:
   - Internet Archive (archive.org) - Best quality FLAC
   - Jamendo - Creative Commons music
   - YouTube - Fallback (up to 256kbps)
3. **Smart Download**: Downloads from first available source
4. **Processing**: Converts to desired format using FFmpeg
5. **Metadata**: Embeds artist, title, album, artwork automatically
6. **Organization**: Saves in organized folder structure
7. **Tracking**: Remembers completed downloads and failed attempts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**FFmpeg not found**: Install with `sudo apt install ffmpeg`  
**No songs found**: Try different search terms or use Spotify URLs  
**Failed downloads**: Use `--retry-failed` to retry, or check `.failed_downloads.json`  
**Quality issues**: Internet Archive and Jamendo provide best quality (FLAC), YouTube is fallback
